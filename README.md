# James – AI Engineer & Multi-Agent Systems Builder

I design and build AI systems that actually ship: multi-agent workflows, end-to-end ML pipelines, security and tools that make decisions instead of waiting for humans to click buttons.

Right now I’m focused on:
- Deep learning (DL Specialization – DeepLearning.AI, in progress)
- Agentic AI (multi-agent systems, tools, and orchestration)
- Practical automation: trading research, data workflows, and applied analytics

My goal is simple: use AI to solve real problems with measurable impact, and grow into a senior / staff-level role (100k+) where I can own systems, not just tickets.

## 🧠 What I Work With

**Core Languages & Tools**
- Python · SQL  
- Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-Learn  
- TensorFlow · PyTorch  
- LangChain · FastAPI · Streamlit  
- Matplotlib / Plotly  
- Google Cloud

**Machine & Deep Learning**
- Architectures: ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers  
- Workflow: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment  
- Evaluation: accuracy, F1, ROC–AUC, precision/recall depending on the problem  
- Optimization: regularization, learning-rate schedules, early stopping, grid/random search, intro Bayesian optimization

**Agentic AI & Automation**
- Multi-agent systems: coordination, role design, and tool-calling flows  
- Prompt and system design for reliability (structured prompts, tools, memory)  
- RAG pipelines: vector stores, retrieval design, and context windows for production-style apps

**Data & Analytics**
- ETL-style workflows and data preprocessing  
- Working with imbalanced data and noisy real-world datasets  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations (time series, distributions, correlations)  
- SQL for analytics: joins, window functions, aggregations, and subqueries

## 🎓 Current Learning & Certifications

**In Progress**
- Deep Learning Specialization – DeepLearning.AI  
- Python · Pandas · SQL · Machine Learning  
- Multi-Agent AI Fundamentals – IBM  
- Build Rich Context AI Apps – Anthropic  
- Generative AI Fundamentals – Google Cloud  

I treat certs as structure, not identity: everything I study ends up in code, repos, or prototypes.

## 🛠 Example Focus Areas

Some of the things I like building and improving:

- **Multi-agent orchestration** for research, analysis, and automated workflows  
- **Trading & decision systems**: backtesting logic, strategy evaluation, risk metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)  
- **Bio/health tooling**: basic analytics, tracking, and experimentation frameworks  
- **Developer tools**: small utilities that remove friction in data and model workflows
- **Offensive automation & recon**
